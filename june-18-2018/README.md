I have uploaded the demo we did in class (Shopping.java). Feel free to download it and play around :)

In order to run it, you'd need to have JAVA installed on your machine, and then set JAVA_HOME in your environment path depending on your OS. 

If you don't have an IDE, you can run it via terminal:
- On Windows use Command Prompt
- On Linux or MacOS use Terminal
and run the following commands: 

```java
cd <TO_WHERE_YOU_DOWNLOAD_SHOPPING.JAVA>
javac Shopping.java
java Shopping
```

Example output: 
```
Enter your item name: Book
Enter your item price: 45.12
Enter a discount rate: 0.05
Enter a tax rate: 0.13

*****RECEIPT*****
Book  $45.12

You pay $48.436319999999995 final price.
===Thank you for shopping at ComIT===
